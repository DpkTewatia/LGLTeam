### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Me and my brothers was a modder since 2019 with other team but it got deleted for good. So I created LGL Team for my brothers, supposedly for releasing mods, it has failed already after they moved away for new job. Joining other new team didn't fit well because they are so toxic. So we decided to just working on open source project and maintaining to help modders instead, easly accessible by everyone.. I will always stay on my LGL Team with my brothers even they are not active much, but they will never leave and always have contact :))) 

Mainly Mod Menu is updated and maintained. As i'm getting more busy these days, I can't always help everyone. Please use search engine for answers, or ask other modders or on any forum modding community as possible

To contact, just go to Mod Menu repo and read. There is no contact to my brothers since they want to remain private

See my repositoriesðŸ‘‰: https://github.com/LGLTeam?tab=repositories

As of March 2021: We began to share all sources of Free Fire and PUBG that we got from someone and anywhere to stop beggers, and shared project we've kept secret ðŸ¤£. Don't ask if you don't know how to use, ask on any forum sites or [UnknownCheats](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/index.php) instead ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
